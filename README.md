# PhP-practice-CRUD
## Simple full CRUD PhP and MySQL app using Bootstrap and JQuery
This project allows users to store a database of people and their locations, you may delete people from the list, or edit people within the list as well

This has been my first run at PhP and my first run with MySQL, I used brew to download necessary technologies and used phpMyAdmin to streamline the creation of my own DB.

Bootstrap was used for 100% of the styling.
